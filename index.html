	<h2>Huskies</h2>
	<p>
		Now we can talk a little about the Siberian Husky!
		We will talk about temperment, history and if a Husky is a good fit for you and your family!Huskies are typically very high energy dogs; daily walks will make for a tired and good companion.  
		Huskies can jump a 4' fence, some choose not to; some huskies can jump or climb a 6' fence.  Huskies love to dig and may try to find friends in China if they get bored in your back yard.  Huskies were bred to run to the horizon and not look back, they should NEVER be let off leash if not in a fenced area.  Huskies have a high prey drive for many small mammals.  This means rabbits, many times cats and even sometimes small dogs. Huskies thrive with a job to do and love to work, if not they will get bored and may choose to chew your shoes or couch. Huskies need routine, consistent meal times, play time and exercise. We strongly recommend a crate for your husky when you aren't home.  Huskies shed.  A LOT.  Invest in a good vacuum. Huskies need their fur in the summer to protect them from the UV rays.  Do not shave them! Huskies don't like to be left alone for long periods of time, many times the companionship of a second dog can be helpful. Huskies typically love people, they don't usually make good watch dogs.
